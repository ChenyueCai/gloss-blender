"""Wire-protocol constants shared by the add-on and the Gloss server.

Every server -> client message carries a ``type`` field so the client can route
it to exactly one consumer. Before this contract existed, replies were
untagged and two Blender timers raced to drain a single shared inbox, which
silently dropped brush icons (see MESSAGING.md).

The server mirrors these constants in
``material-superres-private/gloss_interactive/protocol.py``. Keep the two files
in sync; ``tests/test_protocol.py`` asserts the values match when both repos
are checked out side by side.
